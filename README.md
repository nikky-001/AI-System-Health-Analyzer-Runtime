# 🖥️ AI System Health Analyzer

An AI-based system that monitors system metrics and predicts a real-time **Health Score** along with a **Health Category**.

This project is designed for easy integration into systems such as PCs, routers, and embedded devices.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time system health prediction
* ONNX-based model for cross-platform deployment
* Supports Python and non-Python systems
* Modular and integration-friendly design

### Health Categories:

* Above 90 → Healthy
* Above 65 → Good
* Above 40 → Degrading
* Below 40 → Critical

## ⚙️ Installation (Python Systems)

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## ▶️ Running the System

python main.py

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Update `src/collector.py` to fetch metrics from your system:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Temperature
* Network data
* Uptime

---

## 🔌 Integration Overview

This project supports two types of integration:

### ✅ Python-Based Systems

* Run `main.py` for continuous monitoring
* Or directly use the prediction function from `health_engine.py`

### 🔥 Non-Python Systems (Router / Embedded)

* Use the ONNX model (`model/health_model.onnx`)
* Implement logic using documentation in `docs/`

---

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed integration and implementation steps are available in:

* docs/input_format.md
* docs/feature_logic.md
* docs/integration_guide.md

---

## 🖥️ Output Example

Health Score: 78
Status: Good

---

## 🤝 Use Cases

* System monitoring tools
* Router firmware integration
* IoT device health tracking
* Performance analysis systems

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Time-series forecasting
* Anomaly detection
* Alert system integration
* Advanced UI support
